# CMPEN 472 ASM Projects
 NXP/Freescale HCS12 Assembly Projects for CMPEN 472 at PSU (Spring 2021)  
 Written in NXP/Freescale CodeWarrior IDE 5.9
 
 My code for each HW can be found in **CMPEN472HWxx\Sources\cmpen472hwXX_hutton.asm**, 
 where xx and XX are the HW number (0-11).

 To understand the original assignment for each HW (in case my code comments don't 
 explain well enough), navigate to **Original HW Assignment Pages\hwXX\hwXX.html** to
 read the original assignment documents, including any digital handouts from
 our professor.
