<CENTER><h3>Homework 12: Calculator, Digital Clock, and ADC Data Acquisition Program with HCS12</h3></CENTER>

<p>Due: Dec. 03, 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:30pm

<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>To learn interrupt based multi-tasking programming with multiple interrupt sources.

<h4>Textbook Reading (for next homework):</h4>
<ol>
<li>MC9S12C128 Family Data Sheet: ALL Chapters 
</ol>

<h4>Instruction</h4>

<ol>

<li>Combine the Homework 7, Homework 8, and Homework11; that is, Write a program to make <br>
a calculator, a digital clock, and an Analog Data acquisition on the HCS12 chip.</li>

<br><li>The calculator and digital clock rules are:<br>
<br>
   <ol>
   <li>Input positive decimal numbers only
   <li>Input maximum three-digit numbers only
   <li>Valid operators are: +, -, *, and /
   <li>Input number with leading zero is OK
   <li>Input only two numbers and one operator in between, no spaces
   <li>Show 'Tcalc> 'prompt and echo print user keystrokes until Return key
   <li>Repeat print user input and print answer after the '=' sign   
   <li>In case of an invalid input format, repeat print the user input until the error character
   <li>In case of an invalid input format, print error message on the next line: 'Invalid input format'
   <li>Keep 16bit internal binary number format, detect and flag overflow error
   <li>Use integer division and truncate any fraction
   <li>60 second (0 to 59) clock
   <li>"s" for 'set time' command
   <li>Update the time display every second
   <li>Time display: two 7-segment displays on PORTB 
   <li>Calculator display: on the terminal screen 
   <li>Use Real Time Interrupt feature to keep the time
   </ol>

<br><li>The Terminal display should look something like the 
following (same rules as Homework 7 and 8):

</pre>

<li>In addition to the Calculator and the Digital Clock programs running, 
the ADC Data Acquisition program <br>
should be running also when a user
presses the Switch SW0 at PORTA bit 0.  <br>
The ADC Data Acquisition program is outlined as follows (similar to Homework 11):<br>
<br>
   <ol>
   <li>The SCI port Terminal baud rate at 750Kbaud.
   <li>Activated when the Switch SW0 pressed at PORTA bit 0.
   <li>Start the <b>Timer Module Channel 2 Output Compare</b> interrupt generation at 
       every 125usec (8KHz rate). <br>
       Each time the Output Compare interrupt occurs, carry out the following tasks:<br>

<br>
   <ol>
   <li>Pick up the ADC result (from previous conversion) and set the flag 'happened'.  <br>
       Only the lower 8-bit of the ADC result should be picked up (and saved temporalily, <br>
       to be converted to a decimal representation of the data in ASCII characters in main
       program later).  
   <li>Start a single Analog-to-Digital conversion of the signal on the AN7 pin
   <li>Service the Output Compare (OC2) register (update the counter compare number) for the
       next interrupt. <br>  Also clear the OC2 interrupt flag.
   </ol>
<br>

   <li>In the main program, if the Timer OC2 interrupt 'happened', 
       then send the most recently acquired data <br>
       to the Terminal.  Convert the data to decimal representation in ASCII characters 
       before sending it to the Terminal.
   <li>Repeat until the transmit data count to be 1024
   <li>Print a completion message on the Terminal when the 1024 data transmission completes.
   <li>ADC Data Acquisition repeats every time the Switch SW0 is pressed while the
       Calculator and the Digital Clock is running at the same time.
   </ol>

<br><li>Once your HW12 is finished, run it many times to test that it works.  For the ADC Acquisition,
    Change the analog signal wave frequency as well as the wave type as you test your HW12.
    Repeat the data acquisition and plotting.  Use the same wave form signal files given
    for the HW11</li>

<br><li>Write a report of your HW12 program and your experiments, similar to Homework 11.</li>

<br><li>Make your program user friendly by giving simple directions 
as to how to correctly use your program. </li>

<br><li>Also, make your program 'fool-proof', never crash or stop based on wrong 
user response. </li>

<br><li>You may add other features or decorations.</li>

<br><li>Use as many re-usable subroutines as possible, and make your overall program 
to be small.  So you may re-visit your Homework 7, 8, and 11, and identify the tasks in
your main program that can be made to be subroutines.  Once you made those subroutines,
your main program becomes much simpler and your overall program be smaller.  
In many cases, your program may be run faster too.</li>

<br><li>Design the program to start at $3100 and data to start at $3000.</li>

<br><li>Be sure to put many comments so that grader and others can clearly and
quickly understand your program.  Comments are very
important in assembly language programs.</li>
