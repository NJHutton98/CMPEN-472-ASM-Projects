<CENTER><h3>Homework 11: Analog Signal Acquisition with HCS12</h3></CENTER>

<p>Due: April 23, 2021 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:30pm

<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>To learn timer module interrupt based Analog Signal Acquisition programming.

<h4>Textbook Reading (for next homework):</h4>
<ol>
<li>MC9S12C Family Data Sheet: Chapters 5, 8, 13, and 15
</ol>

<h4>Instruction</h4>

<ol>

<li>Write a program to aquire analog signal through the HCS12 board 
    (simulation) and display the analog signal values on a Terminal window.</li>

<br><li>The program is outlined as follows:<br><br>

   <ol>
   <li>Initialize.
   <li>Your program starts from memory location $3100, data at $3000.
   <li>The SCI port Terminal baud rate set to 2M baud (assuming 24MHz BUS CLOCK).
   <li>Wait for the first Enter key hit on the Terminal
   <li>Print the user guiding messages: <br>
       (1) saving Terminal output to file, <br>
       (2) run analog signal command - connect an analog signal to ADC pin 7, <br>
       (3) when ready, hit SW0 to start the 1024 point ADC data capture.
   <li>Wait for the Switch SW0 pressing (PORTB bit 0).
   <li>Start the <b>Timer Module Channel 2 Output Compare</b> interrupt generation at 
       every 125usec (8KHz rate). <br>
       Each time the Output Compare interrupt occurs, carry out the following tasks:<br>

<br>
   <ol>
   <li>Service the Output Compare (OC) register (update the counter-compare number) for the
       next interrupt. <br>  Also clear the OC interrupt flag.
   <li>Pick up the ADC result (from previous conversion) from the ADC result register. <br>
       And set the flag 'happened'.  Only the lower 8-bit of the ADC result should be picked <br>
       up as the ADC result data.  The picked up result data will be converted to the <br> 
       ASCII characters which represents the decimal number representation of the result data. <br>
       The binary result data to ASCII character change must be done in the main program, <br>
       not in the interrupt service routine.  
   <li>Start another single Analog-to-Digital conversion of the signal on the AN7 pin.
   </ol>
<br>

   <li>In the main program, if the Timer OC2 interrupt 'happened', 
       then convert the most recently acquired ADC result data <br>
       to ASCII characters representing a decimal number.  Then send the ASCII characters to Terminal.
   <li>Repeat for 1024 ADC result data - until the ADC conversion count to be 1024
   <li>Print the completion of the 1024 data transmission.
   <li>Then repeat the last 5 steps when Switch SW0 press happens again.
   </ol>


<br><li>Copy the HW11 sample program file.
    Study it, assemble it, debug it, and run it on the HCS12 simulator.  This program
    converts analog signal to digital data and transmits it in ASCII characters.  This 
    program is used to test the signal connections and ADC operation.  You may use some 
    parts of this program.  Click here for the HW11 sample 
    program - <a href="hw11samp1bSim.asm"> hw11samp1bSim.asm</a> file.  Also you will
    need to save the following two files [right click and select 'Save Link As...' option] 
    to your <b> project folder </b> for simulating ADC: 
    <a href="ADCcon7.cmd"> ADCcon7.cmd</a> and 
    <a href="WAVEsn10.cmw"> WAVEsn10.cmw</a> files. These are the analog signal generator - to be
    connected to the ADC input pin.
    Please follow the <a href="CWchipSimulatorGuideHW11.pdf"> Additional Simulation Guide </a> to 
    connect the ADC input pin to a signal generator.)</li>

<br><li>Additional comments on the Homework 11 (HW11) program are as follows:<br>

<br>
   <ol>
   <li>The Homework 11 program must
       send the 8-bit number in decimal (with ASCII conversion) to Terminal (SCI port).
   <li>The sample program uses busy ADC wait for ADC completion.  But your Homework 11 program <br>
       must use the Timer Module Channel 2 Output Compare interrupt.  Set 125usec (8KHz)
       interrupt rate for each ADC operation.
   <li>Your Homework 11 
       program must do one ADC conversion at the rate of exactly 8KHz, 
       125usec a part.
   <li>The sample program converts ADC input channel 7 signal.  Also your Homework 11 program must
       convert ADC input channel 7 signal.
   <li>The sample program does one conversion per Enter key hit,
       your Homework 11 program must do 1024 conversions per each Push Button SW0 press. 
   </ol>

<br><li>Check the plot and verify the signal frequency.  Use magnify feature to
    see the signal wave details. Identify one cycle of signal wave, check
    how many points are plotted.  (for plotting, one may also use MS Excel) </li>

<br><li>Program Homework 11 such that the program allows you to aquire another set of 1024 point 
        ADC data as follows:<br><br>

   <ol>
   <li>Open Terminal output file.  
   <li>Attache analog signal to AN7 pin
   <li>Press the switch SW0.
   <li>New set of data will be recorded into the 'RxData3.txt' file.<br><br>
   </ol>

<li>Once your Homework 11 program is finished, run it many times to test that it works.  
    Change the analog signal wave frequency as well as the wave type as you test your Homework 11 program.
    Repeat the data acquisition and plotting.</li>

<br><li>Write a report of your Homework 11 program and your experiments.  Your report must include:<br><br>

   <ol>
   <li>Cover sheet with course and your information.
   <li>Sine wave plots.  (Signal files: &nbsp; 
<a href="AWAVE100S.cmd">AWAVE100S.cmd</a> and <a href="AWAVE100S.cmw">AWAVE100S.cmw</a> for 100Hz)
   <li>Square wave plots.  (Signal files: &nbsp; 
<a href="AWAVE100Q.cmd">AWAVE100Q.cmd</a> and <a href="AWAVE100Q.cmw">AWAVE100Q.cmw</a> for 100Hz)
   <li>Triangle wave plots.  (Signal files: &nbsp; 
<a href="AWAVE100T.cmd">AWAVE100T.cmd</a> and <a href="AWAVE100T.cmw">AWAVE100T.cmw</a> for 100Hz)
   <li>Mixed frequency sign wave plots.  (Signal files: &nbsp; 
<a href="AWAVE200S.cmd">AWAVE200S.cmd</a> and <a href="AWAVE200S.cmw">AWAVE200S.cmw</a> for ?Hz and ??Hz)
   <li>For each signal wave, plot full 1024pts and plot magnified 2 signal cycles.
       Note the signal shape difference among square, sign, triangle, and mixed waves.
       Identify one cycle of signal wave, and verify correct signal frequency by
       counting how many points are plotted in one cycle.
   <li>Run FFT on the 1024 point signal wave data (each of S, Q, T, and Mix signal), 
       and plot the FFT results.  You will need to add X axis, the time of each sample point.
       You may use SciLab FFT command.  You should expect one frequency peak for 
       S, Q, and T signals and multiple peaks for Mixed signal.  Use proper horizontal and
       vertical axis, and label them on your plots. 
   <li>Write the detailed explanation of each plot, and each experiments/operations.<br><br>
   </ol>

<li>Create your report file.  (You can capture any window on the
    screen by pressing 'Alt' and 'Print Screen' keys together.  Once captured,
    you can paste the window picture into the .doc file by pressing
    'Ctrl' and 'v' keys together.)</li>

<br><li>You will be sending both the report file and program source file
    for this homework.</li>

<br><li>Make your program user friendly by giving directions as to how to correctly 
    use your program. Once your program is running, everything must be
    self explanatory to user at the Terminal.</li>

<br><li>Also, make your program 'fool-proof', never crash or stop based on wrong 
    user response. </li>

<br><li>Be sure to put much comments so that grader and others can clearly and
    quickly understand your program.  Comments are very
    important in assembly language programs.</li>

<br><li>You may want to see and check the <a href="cmpen472HW11gr01.pdf">
    Sample Grading Sheet</a> for this homework.</li>

<br><li>Copy your 'main.asm' file to 'cmpen472hw11_YourLastName.asm'.
    For example, mine will be 'cmpen472hw11_choi.asm'  Do not ZIP your 
    'cmpen472hw11_YourLastName.asm' file. </li>

<br><li>Name your Homework 11 report file to 'cmpen472hw11_YourLastName_RPT.doc'.
    For example, mine will be 'cmpen472hw11_choi_RPT.doc'  Do not ZIP your 
    'cmpen472hw11_YourLastName_RPT.doc' file.</li>

<br><li>
   Turn-in your project source code file through 
   <a href="https://psu.instructure.com/login/ldap">Penn State CANVAS</a>.
