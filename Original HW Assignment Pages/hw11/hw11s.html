<CENTER><h3>Homework 11: Programming Flash Memory</h3></CENTER>

<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>Read Chapter 21 of the HCS12 Microcontroller data sheet MC9S12C Family. 
And program 40 bytes of data to the flash memory starting at $4800.

<h4>Instruction</h4>

<ol>

<li>Finish reading Chapter 18 of the HCS12 Microcontroller data sheet.<br><br>


<li>Study the sample Flash Memory program 
to store a short program in flash memory:

<!--    -->

<br>
<a href="HW11C128.pdf"> sample Flash Memory program for HCS12C<b>128</b> board</a> 
<br><br>


<li>Write your Flash Memory program to write 40 bytes to flash memory starting at $4800.<br><br>

<li>First 4 bytes of the 40 byte data must be your student ID number (last 4 digits)
in ASCII code.  For example, my ID will be $30, $31, $32, $33 (that is '0123').
The remaining data must be an exact copy of the data block given in the
sample Flash Memory program.<br><br>

<li>The sample Flash Memory program shows flash memory writing subroutine.  You must write
flash memory sector erase subroutine.<br><br>

<li>Flash memory must be erased before the data can be written.  Because you will
be writing only 40 bytes, erase only one sector (1024 bytes) starting at $4800.<br>

<br><li>Design the program to start at $3100 and data to start at $3000 as usual.</li>

<br><li>Be sure to put much comments so that you and others can clearly and
quickly understand your program later.  Comments are very
important in assembly language programs.</li>

<br><li>Do NOT Turn-in your project source code file for this Homework.</li>

<br><li>Be sure to return the CMPEN 472 HC12 Board Kit Box to me - see 
the ANNOUNCEMENT.</li>

</ol>

<p>Congratulations on your CMPEN 472 Course completion!
