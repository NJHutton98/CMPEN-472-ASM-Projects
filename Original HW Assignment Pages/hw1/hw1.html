<h4>Instruction</h4>

<ol>

<li>
Read the textbook Chapters 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3.  You do 
NOT need to understand all of the content.
</li>

<br><li>
Read the textbook Appendix 1.6
</li>

<br><li>
Download two additional textbooks:</br> 
i. S12CPUV2 - Reference Manual (<a href=
"S12CPUV2.pdf">
PDF</a>)</br> 
ii. MC9S12C Family - Data sheet (<a href=
"https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MC9S12C128V1.pdf">
PDF</a>)</br> 
from NXP <a href=
"http://www.nxp.com/products/automotive-products/microcontrollers-and-processors/16-bit-s12-s12x-mcus/s12c-automotive-and-industrial-microcontrollers-mcus:S12C?fpsp=1&tab=Documentation_Tab"> 
Freescale MC9S12C128 Summary/Documentation page.</a>
</li>

<!--  
<br><li>
Print and bind the two textbooks:</br> 
i. S12CPUV2 - Reference Manual (PDF)</br> 
ii. MC9S12C Family - Data sheet (PDF)</br> 
from NXP, you will need them for the mid-term exams and the final exam.
You may want to print 2 or 4 pages per side.
</li>
-->  

<br><li>
Download the class programming tool CodeWarrior. 
Unzip the downloaded file and install the program.</br> 
<a href="CW-Guide1.pdf"> Click here for the download, installation, and
project start guide.</a>
</li>

<br><li>
Now view the Homework 1 sample program <a href="hw1.pdf">hw1.pdf </a> and <a href="hw1b.pdf">hw1b.pdf </a> 
</li>

<br><li>
To enter your first program, create a new project with CodeWarrior.  
And name it cmpen472hw1, which will contain your homework 1 assembly program.
</li>

<br><li>
Create your own 'main.asm' file by typing in the text from the
'hw1.png' file.  For each line, be careful on what character you type on the 
first column.  Each line may include up to four fields: a label, 
an operation (instruction mnemonic or assembler directive), 
operands, and a comment.  Some fields are identified by typed characters 
in a given column.  
<b>Please study and be familiar with MC9S12C128 Assembly Language Syntax!!!</b><br><br>

</li>

<br><li>
Do <b>make</b> the 'main.asm' file and generate the .s19 executable file.
Then, start CodeWarrior debugger.  You may want to click 'Tile' option under the 'Window' menu.
</li>

<br><li>
In the CodeWarrior debugger, click on the 'Execute one' button.
</li>

<br><li>
Click again and watch the various windows - how the program lines are being executed.  
</li>

<br><li>
Try to understand the program.  You may want to read 
the databook/datasheet or reference manual for MC9S12C128 chip.  
They contain complete explanation and descriptions of the instructions.
</li>

<br><li>
Modify the program including the comments.  Have the program 
put 202 stars instead of 10 stars.
</li>

<br><li>
Again assemble and simulate  your program.  Be sure that your 
program does not have errors and it loops 202 times.  You may even 
try adding an error to your program and see what happen when you 
assemble (this is <b>make</b> command) and simulate.
</li>

<br><li>
Be sure to update the comments (put your name, etc.) and correct all the
errors.
</li>

<br><li>
You may want to see and check the <a href="cmpen472HW1gr01.pdf">
Sample Grading Sheet</a> for this homework.
</li>

<br><li>
Copy your 'main.asm' file to 'cmpen472hw1_YourLastName.asm'.
For example, mine will be 'cmpen472hw1_choi.asm'  Then submit your 
file (do NOT ZIP your file).
</li>

<br><li>
   Turn-in your project source code file through 
   <a href="https://psu.instructure.com/login/ldap">Penn State CANVAS</a>.
   Upload your source code file into the CANVAS Assignment's Homework submission.
   Be sure to select CMPEN 472 class and correct Homework number,
   and correct file name.
</li>

</ol>

<p>Congratulations on your very first CMPEN 472 homework completion!
